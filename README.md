# Awoo-Splash
Awoo-Splash for KDE Plasma

A very simple splash screen, inspired by the "Telephone Awoo" video, involving the character Momiji Inubashiri from Touhou Project.
The Dancing Momiji Gif that plays in the center was made by Maitora (Pixiv).

I patched it for QT6 as it was a pretty simple fix ^^
